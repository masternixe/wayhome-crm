# ✅ Security Audit Complete - Office Isolation Verified

## 🔒 Critical Security Fix Applied

### Fixed: User Creation Vulnerability
**File**: `apps/api/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`

**Before**: OFFICE_ADMIN could potentially create users in ANY office by manipulating `officeId` in request

**After**: 
- **Line 71**: `data.officeId = requestingUser.officeId;` - **FORCED** to admin's office
- **Line 74-80**: OFFICE_ADMIN **CANNOT** create SUPER_ADMIN users
- **Line 84-90**: SUPER_ADMIN must explicitly provide officeId

---
